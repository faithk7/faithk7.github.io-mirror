        <h3 class="o-about-item-subtitle">Running</h3>
        <p class="o-about-content">I like to <span class="highlight">jog</span> in my spare time. The
            euphoria after a long run and the freedom to control my pace and rhythm drew me to this activity.
            <br><br>Finished half marathon once at <a

>Charlottesville Marathon</a> in 2019 and now run about 4 miles per day to keep the habit
            of
            running.

        <h3 class="o-about-item-subtitle">Anime</h3>
        <p class="o-about-content">A big fan of anime. Started watching anime since high school and fell in love with
            this world of boundless imagination and creativity immediately. It poses a big influence on me and is the
            reason I got deeply interested in <span class="highlight">Japanese culture and
                language</span>. </p><br>
        <h3 class="o-about-item-subtitle">Music</h3>
        <p class="o-about-content">Mostly listen to <span class="highlight">J-pop</span> and <span
                class="highlight">K-pop</span>,
            with a touch of Jazz. <a href="https://jpop.fandom.com/wiki/Aimer" target="_blank">Aimer</a>
            is
            my favorite singer for her powerful and comforting voice. <br><br>Favorite song: <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1kjy1XLx7I" target="_blank">Polaris</a>.
            <br><br>Recently got into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aimyon" target="_blank"
>Aimyon</a> and Japanese city pop.

        <h2 class="o-about-item-title">Reading</h2>
        <p class="o-about-content">Enjoy reading all kinds of books. Through reading I realize that the human minds are
            limitless,
            while we are bounded by our courage and actions. Like said in the end of <a

            <i>“<span class="highlight">Imagination</span> changes everything.”</i> And extensive reading
            opens up the world of imagination.
